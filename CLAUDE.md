This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is **not a software project**. This is an academic policy research repository containing documentation related to Student Evaluations of Teaching (SET) reform at Cal Poly. The active document is a Quarto Book in `05_New_Committee/` proposing the **Student Learning Experience Survey** as a replacement for the current evaluation instrument established by AS-759-13 (2013).

## Repository Structure

- **01_Proposed_Reforms/**: Earlier OCOB-level reform materials (policy analysis, recommendations, resolution, FAQ, presentation)
- **02_Key_References/**: Research literature references on SET bias, gender bias in evaluations, and relevant legal cases (RFA v. Ryerson)
- **03_Training_Template/**: Training materials for performance evaluation meetings
- **04_Presentation_for_Ad_Hoc_Committee/**: Quarto presentation for the Ad Hoc Committee
- **05_New_Committee/**: **Active working directory** — Quarto Book source (render with `quarto render` from this directory)

## Content Focus

The repository addresses:
- Bias in student evaluations of teaching
- The TEval framework's seven dimensions of teaching (Austin et al., 2025)
- Five aspects of class climate: Respect, Fairness, Participatory Climate, Approachability, Inclusivity
- Scoring and reporting of ordered categorical data (no averages, no cross-comparisons)
- CBA §15.17 alignment for student course evaluations
